<h1>Inspiration</h1>
I was inspired to create this ecommerce website because I noticed a gap in the market for a platform that allows customers to view products in a more immersive and realistic way before making a purchase. I also saw an opportunity to improve the customer experience by adding features like personalized recommendations and customer reviews. I also wanted to create a platform that prioritizes data security and is mobile-friendly, to cater to the increasing number of customers who shop on mobile devices.

I did some research and found that 3D model viewers were being used in some industries, like furniture and interior design, but it wasn't widely used in the ecommerce industry. I thought this could be a great way to differentiate my website from others and give customers a more interactive experience. I also looked at customer feedback and saw that many customers would like to see the products in a more detailed and realistic way before making a purchase.

So I decided to combine the 3D model viewer with other features like personalized recommendations, customer reviews and a mobile-friendly design to create a unique and innovative ecommerce platform that enhances the customer experience. I believe that this platform will be a game-changer in the ecommerce industry and I am excited to share it with the judges.

<h1>What it does</h1>
Kiara is designed to provide customers with an easy and convenient way to browse, purchase, and view products. The website features an interactive 3D model viewer, which allows customers to see products in a detailed and realistic way before making a purchase. Customers can also leave reviews and ratings on products they've purchased, and a personalized recommendation system suggests products based on their browsing and purchase history. Our website also features a live chat feature, loyalty program and a mobile-friendly design to ensure a seamless shopping experience.

This website sets itself apart from others by providing an interactive and immersive experience through the 3D model viewer, and with the added customer reviews and personalized recommendations, customers can make more informed purchasing decisions. Overall, our website is a unique and innovative solution for ecommerce that enhances the customer experience.

<h1>How we built it</h1>
Kiara is build using  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end development and Three.js for the 3D model viewer.

<h1>Challenges we ran into</h1>

Some challenges that I faced while developing Kiara are -

Personalized recommendations: Developing a personalized recommendation system that is accurate and effective could have been a challenge, as it would require data analysis and machine learning techniques.

Mobile optimization: Ensuring that the website is mobile-friendly and optimized for small screens may have been challenging, as it would require careful consideration of the user interface and user experience.
